          In casual language, people use “bugs” to mean all sorts of small
          creepy-crawlies: insects, spiders, etc. However, “Bugs” (true bugs)
          are actually just one order of insects (Hemiptera). This page
          provides a summary of the main classes or groups of
          creepy-crawlies.

        <h2>🐞 Beetles (Coleoptera)</h2>

        <p>
          Beetles make up the largest order of insects, with more than
          350,000 known species. They are recognized by their hardened
          forewings (elytra) that cover and protect the delicate hindwings
          and abdomen. This feature gives them a tough, armored look and
          helps them survive in many environments, from forests to deserts.
          Beetles can vary greatly in size, color, and habits, ranging from
          tiny grain beetles to massive stag beetles with impressive jaws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many beetles play important ecological roles. Some, like ladybugs,
          are beneficial predators that feed on crop pests such as aphids.
          Others, such as dung beetles, recycle nutrients by breaking down
          animal waste. However, certain species like the Colorado potato
          beetle or Japanese beetle are major agricultural pests. Their
          diversity and adaptability make beetles one of the most successful
          groups of insects on Earth.

        <h2>🪲 True Bugs (Hemiptera)</h2>

          <figcaption>A True Bug Photo</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          True bugs include a wide range of insects such as stink bugs,
          cicadas, aphids, and water striders. Unlike beetles, their
          forewings are partly hardened and partly membranous, and they
          possess distinctive piercing-sucking mouthparts. These mouthparts
          are adapted for feeding on plant sap, blood, or other insects. Many
          true bugs have scent glands that produce strong odors as a defense
          mechanism, which is why some are called “stink bugs.”

        <h2>🦋 Butterflies & Moths (Lepidoptera)</h2>
        <figure>
          <img src="butterfly.jpg" alt="A colorful butterfly" width="250" height="180">
          <figcaption>A Big Butterflies Photo</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Butterflies and moths are some of the most recognizable insects
          thanks to their large, often colorful wings covered in tiny scales.
          These scales give their wings shimmering, patterned appearances and
          are one of the defining traits of this group. Butterflies are
          usually active by day, while moths are mostly nocturnal, though
          there are exceptions. Both undergo complete metamorphosis, with a
          dramatic transformation from caterpillar to winged adult.

        <h2>🦟 Flies & Mosquitoes (Diptera)</h2>

          <figcaption>A mosquito Photo</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Flies and mosquitoes belong to the order Diptera, meaning “two
          wings.” Unlike most other insects, they have only one functional
          pair of wings; the hind pair has evolved into tiny balancing organs
          called halteres. This adaptation gives them incredible agility in
          flight.

        </figure>
        <p>
          Bees, wasps, and ants are a diverse group known for their complex
          behaviors and social structures. Many species live in colonies with
          distinct roles for workers, queens, and males. Bees are especially
          famous for pollination, producing honey, and communicating with
          each other through dances.

        <h2>🕷️ Spiders (Araneae)</h2>

        <p>
          Spiders are arachnids, not insects, and are easily distinguished by
          their eight legs and lack of antennae. Almost all spiders are
          predators, using venom and silk to capture prey.

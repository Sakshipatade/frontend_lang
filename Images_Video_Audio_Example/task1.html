    <h1>Basic image embed</h1>
    <img src="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/images/images/blueberries.jpg?raw=true" alt="blueberries image" width="615px" height="419px"/>
    
</body>
</html>

<!--
        To complete the task:

        Add the path to the image to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The image is called blueberries.jpg, and it is available at a path of https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/images/images/blueberries.jpg?raw=true.
        Add some alternative text to an appropriate attribute to describe the image, for people that cannot see it.
        Give the <img> element an appropriate width so that it displays at the correct aspect ratio, and enough space is left on the page to display it. The image's intrinsic size is 615 x 419 pixels.

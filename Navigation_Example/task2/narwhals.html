    <p>Narwhals, often called the "unicorns of the sea," are rare and fascinating whales that live in the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean and nearby seas. Their most distinctive feature is the long, spiral tusk, which is actually an overgrown tooth that can grow up to 3 meters long. This tusk is usually found in males and is believed to play a role in attracting mates, showing dominance, and even sensing the environment. Narwhals usually live in groups called pods and feed on fish, squid, and shrimp found deep in the ocean. Because of their unique biology, scientists study narwhals to learn more about their behavior, communication, and survival in extreme conditions. However, climate change and melting sea ice are threatening their natural habitat, making them vulnerable. Despite these challenges, narwhals remain one of the most mysterious and captivating marine animals, admired by biologists and nature lovers around the world.</p>
